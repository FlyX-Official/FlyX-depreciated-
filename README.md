### Start Front-End Vue server
cd into client directory and do `npm run dev`

If you're doing first time setup/get an error, do `npm install` before doing `npm run dev`

### Start Back-End Express server
cd into server/src directory and do `nodemon app` 

If you're doing first time setup/get an error, do `npm install -g nodemon` and then `npm install` before doing `nodemon app`

Once you have done this you can go to `localhost:8080` to see the site. 
The express server is at `localhost:8081` if you wish to see the raw data.
