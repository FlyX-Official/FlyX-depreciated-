
skiplagged-node-api
===================
A node.js wrapper for the [Skiplagged](http://skiplagged.com) API
Forked from [Node_Skiplagged_API](https://github.com/iguanahotsauce/Node_Skiplagged_API), moved into my own repo cause I wanted to rename the module.

Usage
=====
```javascript
const flightScanner = require('skiplagged-node-api');
const flights = flightScanner(searchOptions);
```

Cheapest Flight
---------------
```javascript
const flightScanner = require('skiplagged-node-api');

const searchOptions = {
  from: 'PDX',
  to: 'JFK',
  departureDate: '2018-02-01'
};

flightScanner(searchOptions).then(console.log);
```

Shortest Flight

  sort: 'path'
};

flightScanner(searchOptions).then(console.log);
```

Hidden City Flights
-------------------
Hidden city ticketing occurs when a passenger disembarks an indirect flight at the connection node. Flight fares are subject to market forces, and therefore do not necessarily correlate to the distance flown. As a result, a flight between point A to point C, with a connection node at point B, might be cheaper than a flight between point A and point B. It is then possible to purchase a flight ticket from point A to point C, disembark at the connection node (B) and discard the remaining segment (B to C).

Using the hidden city tactic is usually practical only for one-way trips, as the airlines will cancel the subsequent parts of the trip once a traveler has disembarked. Thus, round-trip itineraries need to be created by piecing two one-way flights together. This tactic also requires that the traveler have carry-on luggage only, as any checked baggage items will be unloaded only at the flight's ticketed final destination.

FAQ
===
```
  Q) I'm passing a return date but all that's changing is the price.
  A) The data returned by the api is not easy to interpret. The library I built this from did the parsing legwork, I've just done a refactor and maintenance pass. If you wish to try, feel free to open up a Pull Request.

  Q) Why was X feature removed?
  A) My design philosophy is one of data. A library should provide a number of pure functions and let me leverage them as I wish. Writing a small app to email the data, save it in a database, or text it is fairly easy in node-land.
